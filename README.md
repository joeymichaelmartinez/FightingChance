## Concept

Strategic Card game where players take turns drawing cards, attacking other players, and surviving elimination. Players start with two 
civilian pieces at the start, and can gain or lose Civilian pieces depending on the how the game plays out. If a player loses all of their 
civilian pieces, then they are out of the game. A game starts in the Resource Phase, and players draw resources. When everyone ends their 
turn during the resource phase, then the Attacking phase starts. When the Attack Phase ends, an event card is drawn from the event card pile. 
The event card will affect the way the game is being played, and possibly benefit certain players over others.

## Game Flow

The game starts by each player taking two civilian pieces (these are all the same, so they do not need to be picked randomly). 
Then each player takes three food resource cards. The resource card pile has different types of resources, so the pile must be scanned for 
the right cards, and then shuffled immediately after so no one knows the order of the pile. Once the cards are picked, the players must 
choose who goes first. This is determined by whoever distributed the cards. Each player draws one resource card from the resource card pile, 
and adds it to their hand. At the end of their turn, each player must discard a food resource card. If they have no food resource cards, then 
they must discard a civilian. If they have no civilians, then they are out. The other resources a player can draw aside from the food resource 
cards are the soldier resource cards, the wall resource cards, or the monk resource cards. If a player uses their soldier resource cards 
against another player, then the attacked player loses a civilian. If the attacked player has a wall resource card when a player uses their 
soldier resource card, then the attacked player does not lose their civilian. Once a card is used, such as when the soldier card is used to 
attack or the wall card is used to defend, then the card is removed and put into the discard pile next to the resource card pile. When all 
players take their turn during the attack phase, the person who started the round takes a card from the event card pile and places it next to 
the pile. The card will then affect the gameplay. This could range from reversing the order of when players take their turns, to trading card 
hands to another player, to aiding the player in last place, or giving someone who was previously out a chance to get back into the game. 
The game ends when either there is one last person left in the game, or all event cards have been pulled. If there are more than one person 
left, then the person with the most civilians wins. If it is still tied, then the person with the most resources wins. If it is still tied, 
then the players are truly tied, or they can flip a coin, or play rock paper scissors.

# Fighting Chance Rules

**Objective:**

The object of the game is to become the only remaining player with one or more civilian pieces still in possession or the player with the most civilian pieces when all event cards have been drawn. Ties between players with the same number of civilian pieces are determined by whichever player has the most Resource Cards, and if the tie persists, then it is the player with the most Soldier Resource Cards, and then Wall Resource Cards, respectively.



**Equipment provided:**

- Civilian game pieces
- Event Card Deck
- Resource Card Deck
- Starting Player piece



**Setup:**

Choose a player to deal two Food Resource Cards and four civilian pieces to every player including themselves. Distributing the Food 
Resource Cards involves searching through the deck to find enough cards for every player, distributing the card to each player, and then 
reshuffling the deck so that no one will know the order in which the cards will appear. Once this has been completed, place the Resource 
Card Deck and Event Card Deck at the center of the playing surface (table, floor, desk, etc.) so that they are in reach of every player. 
Make sure that there is also enough room next to each deck so that the discarded cards can go next to their respective decks. Also make sure 
that a space is designated for where discarded Civilian pieces can go so players know where to place their Civilian pieces when discarded. 
If the current game is being played after a previous one, then the player who came in last of the previous game can go first. Otherwise, 
the player who dealt the Resource Cards and Civilian game pieces can go first. The starting player is given the Starting Player piece to 
remind players that they are the player starting each phase of the current round.





**Basic Rules:**

Resource Phase: Players begin their turn by drawing a resource card and discarding a food resource card. If the player does not have a food 
resource card, then they must discard a Civilian piece. If the player discards their last Civilian piece, then they are eliminated until 
an event card brings them back, or the game ends. An eliminated player can still keep their Resource Cards for future use, in case they are 
brought back into the game. A player&#39;s turn ends the moment they place down their Food Resource Card, or discard a Civilian piece. The 
player to the left now takes their turn until every player has made their turn. The Resource Phase ends when every player has taken their turn.

Attack Phase: The player that began the previous Resource Phase also begins the current Attack Phase. On their turn, a player can decide to 
attack someone if they have a Soldier Resource Card to do so. If a player chooses to attack another player, they must place their Soldier 
Resource Card face-up on the playing surface, and if the attacked player has a Wall Resource Card, they must place this card on the table 
face-up as well. If the attacked player does not have a Wall Resource Card, then they must discard a Civilian Game piece. If the attacked 
player discards their last Civilian piece, then they are eliminated, and as in the Resource Phase, they can keep their Resources Cards for 
possible future use. The used cards must then be discarded into the pile next to the Resource Card Pile. A player&#39;s turn ends once they 
have decided to either attack someone or not to attack anyone. The player to the left now takes their turn. Once all players have taken their
 turn, the player who began both phases turns the next Event Card face-up and reads the event out loud so that everyone can hear the event
taking place. Based on the instructions indicated on the card, players must respond accordingly. Once the card has been drawn, it is 
discarded next to the Event Card Pile and the Starting Player piece is given to the player to the left, so that now the starting player of 
the next two phases is the player to the left of the current player.



**Additional Rules:**

Monk: It is possible, though rare, that a player will draw a Monk Resource Card during the Resource Phase. This card can attack other players, 
in the same way the Soldier

Resource Card does, but will remove a Civilian even if a person has a Wall Resource Card, and the attacking player obtains the Civilian. 
This can be thought of as &quot;converting&quot; the civilian to another player&#39;s team. Once this card is used, it must be discarded.

Event Cards: There is large list of different possible events to occur throughout the course of the game. A simple example would be the 
Reverse Order Of Gameplay Event Card, which reverses the order in which players take turns during each phase. If this card is drawn, then 
the player to the right will make the next turn after the current player, and the Starting Player Piece must be given to the player to the
right. Simply put, the Starting Player Piece is always passed off in the direction of gameplay.

Cards That Affect the Rest of Gameplay: When the Reverse Order of Gameplay card is drawn, it should be left above the Event Card Deck to 
remind players that its effect will last for the rest of gameplay. Cards similar to this will have an indication at the bottom of their 
description indicating that their effects will last for the rest of the game. Anytime this indication is shown, the card must be left above 
the Event Card Deck, and next to any other cards that are in effect for the rest of the game as well.

First Player Eliminated: When an event card states that its content applies to the &quot;first player eliminated&quot; it should be understood 
that this should apply to the least recently eliminated player. Eliminated players can be thought of as forming a line, where the most recently 
eliminated player goes to the back of the line. Whoever is at the front of the line (I.E. the least recently eliminated player) will be the first 
to come back into the game if an event card is pulled that declares the first person eliminated to come back into the game.

Discarding Cards: All cards must be discarded next to their respective piles (Resource Cards are discarded next to the Resource Card pile, 
Event Cards are discarded next to the Event Card pile). If all cards in the Resource Card pile have been used, then the pile must be shuffled 
so that it can be reused. This pattern can be continued until the game ends.

# Revision Log

- After playing with friends:
  - Made change that players defeated keep their cards
  - Made change to event cards that were deemed too power/affected balance
  - Started with two civilians, four food instead of three of each
  - The person who starts each round changes to the person to the left.
  - Made a resource phase and an attack phase.
- Changes after playing with classmates:
  - Players all draw cards at once during resource phase.
  - Players must put down a resource card during the attack phase, and must reveal what it is on their turn accordingly. 
    Players may &quot;bluff&quot; on their turn
  - Used the fact that their is a rotation of who is drawing the event card to single that person out more often than person in 
    first/last place

# Post mortem

It was ultimately hard to guess on people&#39;s bluffs and people would just put down what they had and food if they had nothing. 
People would just attack randomly and get lucky. There was ultimately very little strategy involved, and so it became a game mostly 
surrounding luck and chance, and people often felt screwed over in the end by the event cards and drawing bad cards. Game is mostly dead,
unless I can find a way to introduce more strategy.
